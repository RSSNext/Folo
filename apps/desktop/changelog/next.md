# What's new in vNEXT_VERSION

## Shiny new things

- Simplified Subscription Feature: Automatically hides subscriptions that have no updates and are fully read. To enable, go to Settings - General Subscription - Hide Read.
- Vim users' expectations: Currently, it supports using the keyboard in the Timeline and entry to complete page turning and switching between entries.

  - When focus in Timeline, you can use `j` and `k` (or `down` and `up` arrow keys) to navigate to previous and next entries, press `Enter` to change focus to the entry content.
  - When focus in Entry Content, you can use `h` and `l` (or `left` and `right` arrow keys) to navigate to previous and next entries, press `j` and `k` (or `down` and `up` arrow keys) to scroll down/up, press `Escape` or `Backspace` to change focus to the timeline.
  - When focus in Subscription, you can use `j` and `k` (or `down` and `up` arrow keys) to navigate to previous and next subscriptions, press `Enter` to change focus to the Timeline, press `Z` to toggle folder collapse when the current focus is a folder.
