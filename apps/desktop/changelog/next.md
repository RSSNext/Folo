# What's new in vNEXT_VERSION

## Shiny new things

- AI Chat for RSS (Folo AI): A personalized, context-aware chat built for readers. The assistant understands your feeds, lists, and reading patterns to help you get more from what you follow.
  - Summarize articles, translate content, and get quick explanations—without leaving your timeline.
  - Ask feed-aware questions (e.g., “What did I miss this week?”) and receive suggestions tailored to your habits.
  - Discover what to read next based on your subscriptions and saved items.
  - Streamlined chat UI with context pickers for feeds, entries, and more.
  - Early preview: we’ll iterate quickly with your feedback.
  - Limited rollout: currently available to a subset of users; we’ll expand testing over time.

## Improvements

- Foundations for richer, feed-aware AI features and future extensibility around the chat module.

## No longer broken
