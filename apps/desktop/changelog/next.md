# What's new in vNEXT_VERSION

## ⚠️ Important

We’ve made some updates to our `user` database to help keep things running smoothly and securely. Some fields—like your name, email, profile image link, handle, bio, and website—now have maximum character limits:

- Name: up to 64 characters
- Email: up to 64 characters
- Profile image link: up to 256 characters
- Handle: up to 36 characters
- Bio: up to 256 characters
- Website: up to 256 characters

If you previously entered information that’s longer than these limits, it will be automatically shortened to fit. Other fields, like your email verification status, two-factor authentication, and social links, are not affected by these changes.

## Shiny new things

- 🎉 Say hello to a snazzy new look for your personal profile! We've sprinkled in some cool social attribute settings to spice things up. But hold onto your hats—this is just the appetizer for our grand social vision! 🚀 Stay tuned for more! 😎

## Improvements

## No longer broken

🎉 Ta-da! We’ve squashed a bunch of pesky bugs you awesome folks in the community pointed out—high fives all around! 🙌 But if something’s still acting wonky, don’t be shy—holler at us with an issue report, pretty please! 😜 Let’s keep the good vibes rolling! 🚀
