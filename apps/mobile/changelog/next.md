# What's New in vNEXT_VERSION

## ⚠️ Important

We’ve made some updates to our `user` database to help keep things running smoothly and securely. Some fields—like your name, email, profile image link, handle, bio, and website—now have maximum character limits:

- Name: up to 64 characters
- Email: up to 64 characters
- Profile image link: up to 256 characters
- Handle: up to 36 characters
- Bio: up to 256 characters
- Website: up to 256 characters

If you previously entered information that’s longer than these limits, it will be automatically shortened to fit. Other fields, like your email verification status, two-factor authentication, and social links, are not affected by these changes.
