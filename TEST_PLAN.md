# Test Plan: Tag Page Search Functionality

**Objective:** To verify the functionality, UI/UX, and basic performance of the newly implemented client-side search feature on tag pages for both mobile and desktop platforms.

**Scope:** This test plan covers search accuracy, UI elements, user experience, and basic performance related to the search input and filtering on tag/view pages. It assumes client-side filtering of already synchronized/available feed content.

---

**I. Functional Testing (for each platform - Mobile & Desktop):**

1.  **Search Accuracy - Per Tag Page/View:**

    - **Test Case 1.1.1 (Positive Match):**
      - **Description:** For each tag page/view (e.g., Articles, Social Media, Pictures, Videos), enter a keyword known to be present in item titles, content, authors, or feed names within that view.
      - **Expected Result:** Only items matching the keyword are displayed. The list updates correctly to show only relevant items.
    - **Test Case 1.1.2 (Negative Match):**
      - **Description:** For each tag page/view, enter a keyword known _not_ to be present in any item of the current view.
      - **Expected Result:** The "No results found for '[keyword]'" message is displayed.
    - **Test Case 1.1.3 (Case Insensitivity):**
      - **Description:** Enter a keyword in lowercase (e.g., "apple") that exists in items with different casing (e.g., "Apple", "APPLE"). Repeat with an uppercase keyword.
      - **Expected Result:** Search results are case-insensitive. All relevant items are displayed regardless of keyword or item casing.

2.  **Searchable Fields Verification:**

    - **Test Case 1.2.1 (Entry Title):**
      - **Description:** Search using a keyword unique to an entry's title.
      - **Expected Result:** The entry with the matching title is displayed.
    - **Test Case 1.2.2 (Feed Name/Title):**
      - **Description:** Search using a keyword unique to the name/title of a feed associated with entries in the current view.
      - **Expected Result:** All entries from that feed (matching other criteria if applicable) are displayed.
    - **Test Case 1.2.3 (Entry Content/Description):**
      - **Description:** Search using a keyword unique to the content or description of an entry.
      - **Expected Result:** The entry with the matching content/description is displayed.
    - **Test Case 1.2.4 (Entry Author):**
      - **Description:** Search using a keyword unique to an author's name associated with an entry. Test with authors stored as strings and as objects (if applicable).
      - **Expected Result:** The entry with the matching author is displayed.

3.  **Clear Search Functionality:**

    - **Test Case 1.3.1 (Clear Button):**
      - **Description:** Enter a search query. Click/tap the 'X' (clear) button in the search input.
      - **Expected Result:** The search query is cleared from the input field. The list restores to display all items for the current tag view. The clear button itself disappears.

4.  **View Change Behavior:**

    - **Test Case 1.4.1 (Switch Tag/View):**
      - **Description:**
        1.  Navigate to a specific tag page (e.g., Articles).
        2.  Enter a search query (e.g., "tech").
        3.  Switch to a different tag page (e.g., Videos).
      - **Expected Result:** The search input field on the Videos page is empty. The Videos page displays its full, unfiltered list of items.
    - **Test Case 1.4.2 (Return to Original Tag/View):**
      - **Description:**
        1.  Follow steps from Test Case 1.4.1.
        2.  Switch back to the original tag page (e.g., Articles).
      - **Expected Result:** The search input field on the Articles page is empty. The Articles page displays its full, unfiltered list of items.

5.  **Empty Query Behavior:**

    - **Test Case 1.5.1 (Initial State):**
      - **Description:** Navigate to any tag page.
      - **Expected Result:** The search input is empty. All items for that tag view are displayed.
    - **Test Case 1.5.2 (After Clearing):**
      - **Description:** Enter a query, then clear it using the 'X' button.
      - **Expected Result:** The search input is empty. All items for that tag view are displayed.

6.  **Special Characters & Edge Cases:**

    - **Test Case 1.6.1 (Query with Spaces):**
      - **Description:** Search with a query containing multiple words separated by spaces (e.g., "New York Times").
      - **Expected Result:** Items matching the multi-word phrase are displayed.
    - **Test Case 1.6.2 (Short Query):**
      - **Description:** Search with a very short query (e.g., 1 or 2 characters).
      - **Expected Result:** List updates accordingly. Performance should remain acceptable.
    - **Test Case 1.6.3 (Long Query):**
      - **Description:** Search with a very long query string.
      - **Expected Result:** List updates accordingly. The input field should handle long text gracefully (e.g., scrolling text if it overflows).
    - **Test Case 1.6.4 (Numbers/Symbols - if applicable):**
      - **Description:** If content can contain numbers or specific symbols, test searching for them.
      - **Expected Result:** Items matching these numbers or symbols are displayed.

7.  **Debouncing Verification:**
    - **Test Case 1.7.1 (Slow Typing):**
      - **Description:** Type a search query character by character slowly into the search input.
      - **Expected Result:** The search results list updates smoothly after each pause (respecting the debounce delay, e.g., 300ms), without excessive flickering or re-renders for every single character typed.
    - **Test Case 1.7.2 (Quick Typing then Pause):**
      - **Description:** Type a search query quickly and then pause.
      - **Expected Result:** The search results list updates once after the debounce delay (e.g., 300ms) from the last character typed.
